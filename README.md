# I4H_3D_Plotter

## Description
This project is a supporting project to my team's [2022 Innovation For Health](https://github.com/thesixtium/I4H) project. It plots 3D points coming in over a certain length of time, technically making the plot 4D as it has all three normal dimensions (X, Y, Z) and also time.

### What It Does
This program monitors a serial communication line to recieve information from our [4D touchscreen](https://github.com/thesixtium/I4H/tree/main/Electrical/Parkinsonstester), and then plots the information in a visually appealing way.

### Technologies Used
The main technology used was Python with the following imports:
* math
* serial
* re
* matplotlib
* numpy
* time

## Installation
This project can be used like any other Python import.
